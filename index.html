          My name is Stanislav Pinchuk, but I go by Stan. I was orignially born in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan used to be part of the Soviet Union but is now its own country. My family and I moved to the USA in 1996 when I was 5 years of age. I grew up in State College, PA and moved to Charlotte, NC in 2005.

          I am an aspring Full Stack Developer. I got interested in the IT field a few years after I graduated High School. I started working in Networking but had always wanted to study programming. After a few years in the IT industry I finally got the chance to study coding. So far I am enjoying programming very much. After completing my Full Stack Developer program I plan on continuing studying more programming languages.

          On my free time when I am not studying I enjoy going to the gym, fixing cars and motorcycles. However, I no longer work with motorcycles as much as I used to. In early 2018 I collapsed a disk in my spine and now riding motorcycles agitates my back. So most of the time I stick to working on cars now. My brothers and I are currently working on building a race car for the "24 hours of Lemmons" race in September.
